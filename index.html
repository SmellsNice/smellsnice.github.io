		<h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>

		<h2>Introductions</h2>

		<p>My name is <b>Boran Yıldırım</b>. I am currently studying at the <b>Electrical and Electronics Engineering Faculty</b> of <b>Hacettepe University</b> as a Sophomore. My biggest hobby is drawing but I also enjoy tinkering with self-hosted software and open source software in general. This website will mostly be used for school related activities, but I may update it in the future for other relevant things (If I don't forget about it in the first place). So most of the changes here will be in related to my homework submissions and other stuff like that. </p>

		<h2>Relevant Resources</h2>
